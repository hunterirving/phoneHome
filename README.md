<h3>phoneHome is a suite of tools to make dumbphones smarter</h3>

phoneHome runs on any old computer you have lying around (so long as it's got ___innanet___),
<br>and executes this main loop ad infinitum:

1. listen for incoming SMS text messages
2. attempt to interpret recieved messages as commands
3. if a recieved message contains a recognized command, execute the command, then...
4. send a response back to the user as an SMS text message

<h3>phoneHome is modular</h3>

phoneHome's modular design allows you pick and choose the features you want, rendering your phone <br>
_"just as smart as you want it to be."_

<img src="res/modulardesign.png" width="24%">

<h3>phoneHome is multi-user</h3>

A freedom most unprecidented - any number of users can interact with the software simultaneously.

Commands are evaluated in the order they are recieved, and multiplayer, text-based games are possible (2 player, SMS text-based Chess has already been implemented, and a Multi-User Dungeon Crawler has been planned).

# Okay... but _Why?_

___Smartphone Addiction___ is a very real and very serious condition that affects an estimated....... __everyone.__

The obvious-but-hard-to-swallow cure for Smartphone Addiction is, obviously, ditching your smartphone.

But unless you're a hippie or a cave hermit, you'll probably still want to carry _something_ around in your pocket for talking to people... just maybe something with a few less distracting features... Maybe something like

___A dumb phone.___

<img src = "res/dumbphone.jpg" width="50%" length="50%">

There is a very real honeymoon phase.<br><br>
Just calls and texts! You've got everything you need, and nothing you don't.<br>
It's elegant.<br>
It's nostalgic.<br>
It's... <b>ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ.</b>

You won't miss Facebook or the incessant notifications, but soon enough you'll find yourself missing the useful tools that those so-called-smartphones come with as standard:
<br><br>
>_"It sure would be nice to know today's weather forecast....." <br><br>
>"I wish I didn't have to call my brother to ask for Google Maps directions......" <br><br>
>"WTF is a 'kumquat'.....?"<br><br>
>"ok....... what if I could summon an uber............. from a dumbphone..............."_
<br>

almost everything you could ever want to capture with a photograph has already been captured in a photograph.

phoneHome uses an advanced image generation algorithm (aka Google images) to "generate" images based on your text description of the scene you see before you.

images are uploaded to <b><a href="http://www.instagram.com/huntersdumbphone">The Cloud™</a></b> where your friends can like™ and comment™ on (approximations of) your exciting life.
