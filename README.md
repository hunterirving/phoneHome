<h3>phoneHome is server-side software</h3>

phoneHome runs on any old computer you have lying around (so long as it's got ___innanet___),
<br>and executes this main loop ad infinitum:

1. listen for incoming SMS text messages
2. attempt to interpret recieved messages as commands
3. if a recieved message contains a recognized command, execute the command, then...
4. send a response containing the output from running the parsed command back to the sender as an SMS text message
</i>

<h3>phoneHome is modular</h3>

phoneHome's modular design allows you pick and choose the features you want, rendering your phone <br>
_"just as smart as you want it to be."_

<h3>phoneHome is multi-user</h3>

A freedom most unprecidented.<br>
You can add an __UNLIMITED__ amount of users to ___user.py___'s whitelist, and any number of users can interact with the software simultaneously.

Commands are evaluated in the order they are recieved, and multiplayer, text-based games are possible (2 player, SMS text-based Chess has already been implemented, and a Multi-User Dungeon Crawler has been planned).

# Okay... but _Why?_

___Smartphone Addiction___ is a very real and very serious condition that affects an estimated....... __everyone.__

The obvious-but-hard-to-swallow cure for Smartphone Addiction is, obviously, ditching your smartphone.

But unless you're a hippie or a cave hermit, you'll probably still want to carry _something_ around in your pocket to talk to people... just maybe something with a few less distracting features... Maybe something like

___A dumb phone.___

There's a very real honeymoon phase - you've got just what you need, and nothing you don't.<br>
It's elegant.<br>
It's nostalgic.<br>
It's... ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ.

Soon though, you'll find yourself missing the useful tools that so-called-smartphones come with as standard.
