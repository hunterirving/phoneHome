<h3>phoneHome is server-side software</h3>

phoneHome runs on any old computer you have lying around (so long as it's got ___innanet___).

Here's the main loop:<i>
1. listen for incoming SMS text messages
2. attempt to interpret recieved messages as commands
3. if a recieved message contains a recognized command, execute the command, then...
4. send a response containing the output from running the parsed command back to the sender as an SMS text message
</i>

<h3>phoneHome is modular</h3>

phoneHome's modular design allows you pick and choose the features you want, rendering your phone <br>
_"just as smart as you want it to be."_

<h3>phoneHome is multi-user</h3>

A freedom most unprecidented.<br>
You can add an __UNLIMITED__ amount of users to ___user.py___'s whitelist, and any number of users can interact with the software simultaneously.

Commands are evaluated in the order they are recieved, and multiplayer, text-based games are possible (2 player text-based chess is already implemented).

# Okay... but _Why?_
