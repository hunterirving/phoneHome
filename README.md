almost everything you could ever want to capture with a photograph has already been captured in a photograph.

phoneHome uses an advanced image generation algorithm (aka Google images) to "generate" images based on your text description of the scene you see before you.

images are uploaded to <b><a href="http://www.instagram.com/huntersdumbphone">The Cloud™</a></b> where your friends can like™ and comment™ on (approximations of) your exciting life.
